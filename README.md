# Linux File System:

### Linux path traversal commands
This simulator mimics the linux file system.
Using this we can perform following commands.
- pwd
- mkdir
- ls
- rm
- cd

The `pwd` has `O(h)`  time complexity, where `h` is the depth of the current directory.

##### Data structure used:
Self referential, bi-directional tree data structure
